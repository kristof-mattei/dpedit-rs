DPEdit is a simple command line utility to accurately set the relative position of displays in a dual- or multi-monitor setup.

## Usage

Basic command syntax is as follows:
```
dpedit.exe <displayNum> <xPos> <yPos> [<displayNum2> <xPos2> <yPos2>] ...
```
`<displayNum>` is the index of the display to position (can be listed using `dpedit.exe /L`)

`<xPos>` is the X, or horizontal, position, in pixels, of the top-left corner of display `<displayNum>`.

`<yPos>` is the Y, or vertical, position, in pixels, of the top-left corner of display `<displayNum>`.

NOTE: Display #1 remains at position {0, 0} at all times. Specifying its location at all is entirely optional.
If its location is set (E.G. on a single-monitor system), the wallpaper will be offset accordingly. However, it will still be at position {0, 0}.

## Examples

> Command Line:
> ```
> dpedit.exe 1 0 0 2 -1920 21
> ```
> Powershell (Windows Terminal):
> ```
> ./dpedit.exe 1 0 0 2 -1920 21
> ```

Moves Display #1 to coords {0, 0} and positions Display #2 to the left of
and 21 pixels lower than Display #1 (coords {-1920, 21}).
This example assumes Display #2 to be 1080p.


Results in the following monitor configuration:

> ```
> dpedit.exe 2 0 1080
> ```
> Powershell (Windows Terminal):
> ```
> ./dpedit.exe 2 0 1080

Assuming Display #1 is at coords {0, 0}, positions Display #2 below Display #1 (coords {0, 1080}).
This example assumes Display #1 to be 1080p.
